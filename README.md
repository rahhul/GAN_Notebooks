## t-SNE
Original Paper: http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf
t-SNE is often successful in revealing clusters and sub-clusters in high-dimensional data. 
t-SNE is computationally intensive compared to PCA. PCA cannot capture non-linear dependencies.
t-SNE is not limited to linear projections, which helps capture relationships in high-dimensional data, but requires parameter tuning. => https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/
