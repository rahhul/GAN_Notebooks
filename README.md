## t-SNE
Original Paper: http://jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf <br>
t-SNE is often successful in revealing clusters and sub-clusters in high-dimensional data. <br>
t-SNE is computationally intensive compared to PCA. PCA cannot capture non-linear dependencies.<br>
t-SNE is not limited to linear projections, which helps capture relationships in high-dimensional data, but requires parameter tuning. => https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/ <br>

Successful interpretation of t-SNE plots often requires analyzing multiple plots generated with different values for parameters such as 'perplexity'. => https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html
